# Social Network API

## Description

Social Network API is a mongoDB-based back-end application. It is capable of storing users, storing users' friends, storing 'thoughts' created by the users, and storing 'reactions' to the individual thoughts.

Creating this project has helped me gain a deeper understanding of creating collections within a Mongo database. It has helped me understand modeleing and CRUD operations.

Future work on this project includes, primarily, creating a front-end to create a prototype product that can be used with the need for an API platform.

## Installation

Installation of Node.js is required to run this module. Additionally, The node packages express and mongoose must be installed.

## Usage

To start using the Social Network API, the server will need to be initiated. Since there are no seeds for this application, any test data will need to be generated by posting with an API platform such as Insomnia or Postman.

To start this application, type npm start into Terminal or Bash.

Since this is a back end only application an API platform such as Insomnia or Postman must be used to be able to interface with the application.
